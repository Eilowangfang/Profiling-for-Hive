Step2: linux shell "cat ds100_query4.log| grep -E "Fang: Tez|Container: container" > tmp.log"
	then we obtain a log that contains all the statistics info. useful for profiling.

Step3: g++ --std=c++11 main.cpp -o extracter
	then we obtain executable file "a.out".

Step4: ./extracter
	then we obtain the statistics file "Profile.csv".
